# COMP90088-ResearchProject-DEXDataCollector
 
This repo has some notebooks that fetch and display data on decentralized exchanges:
- bitquery_eth.ipynb, set the toggle LOAD_FROM_FILE to false to load data from file and display it. If set to true (and fetch up to date data), the user needs to provide a BitQuery api key in a yaml file named 'api.yaml'
